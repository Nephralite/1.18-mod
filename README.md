# 1.18-mod
A mod built for fun to help learn java and minecraft modding. currenty just adds an ore and a tree and associated items.
this build is like 95% done, so i'm gonna take a break from it for a while.

known problems:
some recipes are missing
item tags aren't fully implemented
the mob is WIP, in a pretty bad state
ore doesn't generate yet
sign can't be placed
forgot to make a cherry boat :(
